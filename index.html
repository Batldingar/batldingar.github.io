<b>Accuracy and updating your information</b><br>
If you believe that the personal data, we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please contact us. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer your requests.<br><br>

Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of Personal Data, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.<br><br>

<b>Collection of Personal Data</b><br>
Personal data may be collected in two ways, that is directly when you for example volunteer it to us or automatically for example when you install and use our Game. As indicated above we have made sure that as little as possible information that directly identifies you is collected.<br><br>

<i>When you contact us</i><br>
If you contact us per e-mail, your transmitted personal data will be automatically stored for the purpose of processing the request or contacting you. We delete the data accruing in this context after the storage is no longer necessary for the processing of your request or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest and/ or a contractual or precontractual measure.<br><br>

Automatically collected data<br>
<i>a) Downloading the Game</i><br>
The Game can be downloaded from the "Google Playstore"  a service offered by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, US, if you are resident outside the EU and Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland if you are a resident within the EU, and downloading it may require prior registration with the respective App store and/or installation of the respective App store software.<br><br>

<i>b) Installing the Game</i><br>
You can use the Google service "Google Play", to install our Game. As far as we are aware, Google collects and processes the following data: License check, network access, network connection, WLAN connections, and location information. However, it cannot be ruled out that Google also transmits the information to a server in a third country. We cannot influence which personal data Google processes with your registration and the provision of downloads in the respective App store and App store software. The responsible party in this respect is solely Google as the operator of the Google Play Store.<br><br>

<i>c) Device information</i><br>
We or rather Google on our behalf collects information from and about the device(s) you use to access the Game, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and APP settings and properties, APP crashes, advertising IDs (AAID), information about your wireless and mobile network connection such as your service provider and signal strength; information about device sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass.<br><br>

<b>How we use information?</b><br>
The main reason we use your data is to deliver and improve our services as follows:<br><br>
      
      <i>- to provide our Game to you,</i><br>
      <i>- provide you with customer support and respond to your requests,</i><br>
      <i>- to improve our Game and develop new features and services,</i><br>
      <i>- retain data related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences,</i><br>
      <i>- to ensure legal compliance,</i><br>
      <i>- assist law enforcement, and</i><br>
      <i>- enforce or exercise our rights.</i><br><br>

<b>How long do we store your data?</b><br>
We keep your personal data only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account deletion. During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.<br><br>

In practice, we delete or anonymize your data upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window), unless:<br><br>

<i>- we must keep it to comply with applicable law,</i><br>
<i>- we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law,</i><br>
<i>- there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant data until it is resolved, or</i><br>
<i>- the data must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users’ safety and security.</i><br><br>

Keep in mind that even though our Game is designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above standards, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time-frame due to technical constraints.<br><br>

<b>Duration of data storage</b><br>
In general, your Game data is saved and stored on your device and we only store personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed or for as long as any consent you have given us has been revoked by you. Insofar as statutory retention obligations must be observed, the storage period for certain data may be up to 10 years, irrespective of the processing purposes.<br><br>

<b>How do we protect your data?</b><br>
We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data. As with all online technology, we take steps to secure your data, however we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal data will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical, and organizational security measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.<br><br>

<b>How we share your data?</b><br>
We may disclose your personal data to third parties:<br><br>

<i>- for the purposes of providing services that you request from us, fulfilling our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, in connection with your use of the Game,</i><br>
<i>- in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, or</i><br>
<i>- if we or substantially all of our shares or assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.</i><br><br>

We may also disclose your personal data to a governmental or regulatory body, law enforcement, or other authorities, in order to enforce our terms of use for the Game, to cooperate with any direction, request or order from such parties or to report any suspected unlawful activity.<br><br>

<b>Obligation to provide personal data</b><br>
You are not obliged to provide us with personal data. However, depending on the individual case as described above, the provision of certain personal data may be necessary for the provision of the services. If you do not provide us with this personal data, we may not be able to provide the requested service.<br><br>

<b>Authorizations and Access</b><br>
We may request permission to store your Game data including your high scores in text file from your mobile device. The legal basis for data processing is our legitimate interest and the provision of contractual or pre-contractual measures. You can deny the storage of game data on your device via Settings/Notifications/ in your device, however this means that your game data cannot be saved.<br><br>

<b>Uninstall</b><br>
You can stop the collection of information by our Game by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall procedure for your device.<br><br>

<b>Automated individual decision-making including profiling</b><br>
We do not make automated decisions in individual cases, including profiling.<br><br>

<b>Changes</b><br>
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to improve our Game, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.<br><br>
